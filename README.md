# Coffee Sales Data Analysis – Spring Internship 2026

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of transactional coffee sales data to identify revenue patterns across products, weekdays, and time periods. A baseline Linear Regression model was also implemented to forecast next month’s revenue.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 3,547 transaction records including:
- Coffee type
- Revenue (money)
- Time of day
- Weekday
- Month name
- Date and time of transaction

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Time-Based Revenue Trend Analysis
5. Linear Regression Forecasting
6. Model Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
